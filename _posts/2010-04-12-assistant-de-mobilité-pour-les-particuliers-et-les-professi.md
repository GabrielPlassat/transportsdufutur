This morning GreenRoad announced that it has <a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/02/prweb3632994.htm"">raised another $10 million</a> from the Generation IM Climate Solutions Fund, which was <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2009/12/07/david-blood-a-strong-cop15-treaty-will-unleash-innovation-green-economy/"">created by investor David Blood</a> and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The so-called Blood and Gore duo join a long list of investors including Richard Branson’s Virgin Green Fund, and the VCs at Benchmark Capital.</span></p> <p><span lang=""EN"">GreenRoad’s system uses sensors, an accelerometor, GPS and customized algorithms to calculate the relative risk of different driving maneuvers, then communicates that to the driver by illuminating either a red, yellow or green light. Installed mainly on commercial fleet vehicles (80 fleets so far), the device can have its algorithm customized according to a customer’s priorities, and it communicates information via cellular networks to GreenRoad’s data center. </span></p> <p><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>  <!--more-->  <p><span lang=""EN"">“The brains are in the vehicle,” GreenRoad marketing chief Eric Weiss told us earlier this month, so even in areas without cellular coverage, drivers “always get real-time feedback.” Earlier this month <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2010/02/05/greenroad-maxing-out-mpg-with-real-time-feedback/"">Earth2Tech’s Josie explained the service as</a> “think of it as a friendly backseat driver with a remarkable mind for calculating risk and a keen ability to cut your fuel use and emissions.”</span></p> <p><span lang=""EN"">The crucial part of GreenRoad’s tool is the real-time service. It’s only through constant reminding that the driver will change his/her behavior. Without that piece the service would just be a more high-tech driving lesson. The Prius’s dashboard has been one of the pioneers of showing how drivers will utilize real-time information to affect their driving decisions.</span></p> <p><span lang=""EN"">Companies that are building tools for the power grid, like home energy management dashboards, are also starting to embrace real-time data. <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2010/02/19/cali-utilities-get-ready-to-give-your-customers-smart-meter-data/"">The California Public Utilities Commission has said</a> that it wants the the big investor-owned utilities to provide customers and approved third parties with “near real time” data from smart meters. Check out <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2009/06/05/why-the-smart-grid-wont-have-the-innovations-of-the-internet-any-time-soon/"">this piece I wrote last year</a> about how important real-time data is for changing home energy consumption and also for delivering innovation.</span></p> <p><span lang=""EN"">GreenRoad isn’t the only one looking to provide real-time driving feedback to make transportation more efficient. A lot of the big car companies are starting to investigate this space. <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2010/02/05/greenroad-maxing-out-mpg-with-real-time-feedback/"">Ford has developed an instrument cluster</a> that provides basic information. Honda developed a video game-like system called “Eco Assist” for its new Insight that’s meant to not only provide fuel-efficiency feedback, but also “actually help drivers to learn a better way of driving through instruments and electronic indications,” as chief engineer Yasunari Seki <a href=""http://earth2tech.com/2009/05/29/greenroad-fuels-up-with-more-vc-cash/"">told us last year</a>. And last year Volvo unveiled a prototype of its CO2 “pedometer” software, which lets mobile-phone users track their daily travels and carbon footprint.

The company has now raised close to $50 million.</span></p>"
