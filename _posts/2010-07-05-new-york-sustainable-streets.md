<p>Since taking over as New York City's Commissioner of the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/home/home.shtml"><font color="#604dbf">Department of Transportation</font></a> in mid-2007, <a href="http://www.streetfilms.org/archives/tag/janette-sadik-khan"><font color="#604dbf">Janette Sadik-Khan</font></a> has taken on the challenge of making NYC streets more bike & pedestrian friendly while emphasizing livable streets and re-orienting them to accommodate all modes. She and her staff have done it quickly with innovative concepts, thinking outside the box and drawing on successful street designs from around the world to come up with a NYC model that is already changing the way our city feels.</p>  <p><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>  <!--more-->  <p><span lang="EN-GB">With the NY State Department of Transportation and the New York Police Department, NYCDOT opened a new Joint Traffic Management Center (JTMC) in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Long Island</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB">City</span><span lang="EN-GB"> in November 2008. The Center brings together in one room all of the agencies responsible for detecting and responding to roadway incidents within the five boroughs. Staff from NYSDOT, NYCDOT and NYPD observe camera feeds aroundthe- clock and share information on the exact nature of unplanned occurrences and the appropriate response. The JTMC also has several means for notifying the public of highway incidents. Staff can activate any of the nearly 100 electronic variable message signs along the roadways and provide Highway Advisory Radio announcements to notify travellers of area delays.</span></p> <p><a href="https://gabrielplassat.github.io/transportsdufutur/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/old/6a0120a66d2ad4970b0133f210d254970b-pi.jpg"><img alt="Ny_trafic_control" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0120a66d2ad4970b0133f210d254970b " src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/old/6a0120a66d2ad4970b0133f210d254970b-800wi.jpg" title="Ny_trafic_control" /></a></p> <p>Sustainable streets are described below with many actions on transportation :</p> <div id="__ss_4680713"><strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur/ny-ss09-updatelowres" title="Ny ss09 update_lowres">Ny ss09 update_lowres</a></strong>   <div>View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">documents</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur">transportsdufutur</a>.</div> <div>The <strong><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/streetdesignmanual.shtml" target="_blank">New York City Street Design Manual</a></strong> provides policies and design guidelines to city agencies, design professionals, private developers and community groups for the improvement of streets and sidewalks throughout the five boroughs.
