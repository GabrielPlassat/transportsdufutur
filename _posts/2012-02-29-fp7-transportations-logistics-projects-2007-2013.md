<p style="text-align: justify">Tous les projets en cours dans le domaine des transports de personnes et de marchandises soutenus par la Commission Européenne sont dans le document ci-dessous. En utilisant le module de recherche du document pdf vous pouvez accéder à vos besoins.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Quatre projets par exemple : </strong></p>   <!--more-->   <p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.dimec.unige.it/PMAR/picav/objectives.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>PICAV </strong></a>: Personnal Intelligent City Accessible Vehicle System.</p> <ul> <li>New mobility concept for passengers ensuring accessibility for all in urban pedestrian environments;</li> <li>New transport system that integrates a fleet of PICAV units;</li> <li>Some of its features are specifically designed for people whose  mobility is restricted for different reasons the main drivers of PICAV  design are: ergonomics, comfort, stability, small size, mobility  dexterity on-board intelligence, assisted driving, eco-sustainability,  parking, vehicle/infrastructures intelligent networking.</li> </ul> <p style="text-align: justify">PICAV system usefully integrates the existing public transport system  to make it become more accessible for older and disabled people by  acting as a smooth link between walking, bicycle and conventional public  transport.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.viajeo.eu/" target="_blank"><strong>VIAJEO </strong></a>: The Viajeo project will design, demonstrate and validate an open  platform which will facilitate data sharing and exchange from different  sources and provide data processing and management to support a variety  of services. The project will integrate the open platform with local  components and demonstrate its applications in four cities: Athens, São  Paulo, Beijing and Shanghai.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">The open platform will benefit travellers, transport planners and  transport system operators and managers. The open platform will be able  to support cross-modal journey planning and seamless traveller  information service. Data exchange between operators will lead to a  better optimized operation of all systems and individual operation  strategies can be harmonized by the data exchanges and information  sharing. The platform will enable all data and information used for  real-time operation to be used for transport planning. Transport planner  will have access to traffic data and information on traffic management  strategies. Such information will lead more detailed and comprehensive  historical database for transport modelling development and long term  policy evaluation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.turblog.eu/" target="_blank"><strong>TURBLOG_WW :</strong></a> The  project puts together past urban <strong>logistics </strong>experiences and good  practices, analyses them, extracts lessons learned, and disseminates the  information at national, European and intercontinental levels, which  supports ongoing and future related urban logistics plans.  TURBLOG_WW  aims at improving awareness, enhance cooperation and exchange of  experiences in city logistics best practices between European countries  and countries worldwide but with a <strong>focus on the transfer of experiences between the EU, </strong><strong>Brazil and </strong><strong>Peru</strong>.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"><a href="http://www.integrity-supplychain.eu/" target="_blank"><strong>INTEGRITY </strong></a>: Kernel of the project is the development of the so-called Shared  Intermodal Container Information System (SICIS) allowing authorised  companies and authorities to access planning and status information of  selected transports. Proactive planning following the Supply Chain Event  Management (SCEM) approach allows to forecast problems well before they  might occur. Matching logistics data with security information, e.g.  from electronic seals, container security devices, and scanning  equipment together with the integration of the AEO (authorised economic  operator) approach allow to satisfy both the logistics industry and  Customs Authorities fulfilling their duties thus creating win-win  situations.</p> <div id="__ss_11798557" style="width: 477px"><strong style="margin: 12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur/fp7-projects-transports" title="Fp7 projects transports">Fp7 projects transports</a></strong>          <div style="padding: 5px 0 12px">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">documents</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur">Les transports du futur</a>.</div> </div>
