<p style="text-align: justify">The European Council discussed the proposed CO2 emission standards for light commercial vehicles. The agreed text introduces a limit of 175 g CO2/km for the average CO2 emissions from new vehicles registered in the EU. This target will apply to a small van of average mass while specific targets for individual vehicles would vary according to their weight. The limits will be phased in between 2014 and 2017.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">In order to give planning certainty to industry, a long-term target of 147 g CO2/km for light commercial vehicles in 2020 has been included.  The modalities for reaching the target are to be  stablished in a  revision of the regulation by January 2013.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">To incentivize investment in new technologies, from 2014 producers  have to pay a penalty if their  fleet fails to meet the CO2 limit. As  in the legislation for cars, the premium depends on how far  manufacturers exceeded the target. A maximum penalty of EUR 95 per vehicle for exceeding the target has been agreed.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Proposed in November 2009, the draft regulation (15317/09) complements  EU rules on CO2 emissions limits for new passenger cars (443/2009).  The agreed text will be confirmed by the European Parliament at an  upcoming plenary session and adopted formally by the Council after  legal-linguistic revision.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"> </p>  <!--more-->   <div id="__ss_6696435" style="width: 477px"><strong style="margin: 12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur/ldt-co2" title="Ldt co2">Ldt co2</a></strong>        <div style="padding: 5px 0 12px">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">documents</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/transportsdufutur">transportsdufutur</a>.</div> </div>
