<p style="text-align: justify">SOER 2010 provides a set of assessments of the current state of Europe's environment, its likely future state, what is being done and what could be done to improve it, how <strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/europe-and-the-world/megatrends" target="_blank">global megatrends </a></strong>might affect future trends… and more, like specific country profile (<strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/fr#c6=CommonalityReport&c6=FlexibilityReport&c12=all&c5=" target="_blank">France </a></strong>for example).</p> <p style="text-align: justify">The <strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/synthesis/synthesis" target="_blank">SOER 2010 Synthesis</a></strong> provides an overview of the European environment's state, trends and prospects, integrating the main findings of SOER 2010. It is available in <strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/synthesis/translations" target="_blank">many language versions</a></strong>. SOER 2010 includes 13 Europe-wide thematic assessments of key environmental themes: </p>  <!--more-->   <dt style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/europe/understanding-climate-change">Understanding climate change — SOER 2010 thematic assessment </a>: Average global air and ocean temperatures are rising, leading to the melting of snow and ice and rising global mean sea level. Ocean acidification results from higher CO2 concentrations. </dt><dt style="padding-left: 30px"></dt><dt style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/europe/air-pollution">Air pollution — SOER 2010 thematic assessment</a> : Emissions of air pollutants derive from almost all economic and societal activities. They result in clear risks to human health and ecosystems. In Europe, policies and actions at all levels have greatly reduced anthropogenic emissions and exposure but some air pollutants still harm human health. Similarly, as emissions of acidifying pollutants have reduced, the situation for Europe's rivers and lakes has improved but atmospheric nitrogen oversupply still threatens biodiversity in sensitive terrestrial and water ecosystems. The movement of atmospheric pollution between continents attracts increasing political attention. Greater international cooperation, also focusing on links between climate and air pollution policies, is required more than ever to address air pollution. </dt><dt style="padding-left: 30px"></dt><dt style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/europe/urban-environment">Urban environment — SOER 2010 thematic assessment</a> : The global population is congregating in our cities. Eighty per cent of the world’s estimated nine billion people in 2050 are expected to live in urban areas. Our cities and urban areas face many challenges from social to health to environmental. The impacts of cities and urban areas are felt in other regions which supply cities with food, water and energy and absorb pollution and waste. However, the proximity of people, businesses and services associated with the very word ‘city’ means that there are also huge opportunities. Indeed, well designed, well managed urban settings offer a key opportunity for sustainable living. </dt> <p style="text-align: justify">SOER 2010 is aimed primarily at policymakers, in Europe and beyond, involved with framing and implementing policies that could support environmental improvements in Europe. The policy areas covered are: <strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/policy-makers/transport-policy" target="_blank">Transport policy</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/policy-makers/energy-policy" target="_blank">Energy policy</a></strong>, ...</p>
