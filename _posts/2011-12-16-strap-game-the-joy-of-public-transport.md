His idea for a <a href="http://www.coroflot.com/jq/The-joy-of-waiting/">Game Strap</a> is a pretty creative one, and we hope that one day it becomes a reality. <p style="text-align: justify">The design would include a display is powered by the grip of your  hand, and when you let go the game is over. It would also alert you via  the display and a vibration when you’re arriving at a station, so that  you don’t get carried away and miss your stop.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Admittedly, it would be expensive to outfit a train with so many of  these Game Straps, although perhaps ad agencies might get in on the  action with branded games — because if you’re going to be bombarded with  ads on a subway, it would be nice to enjoy them at least.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Here in Tokyo, such a device would have to compete with people’s <a href="http://www.penn-olson.com/tag/smartphone/">smartphones</a>, <a href="http://www.penn-olson.com/tag/Nintendo/">Nintendo</a> DSs, and PSPs for attention. Perhaps a network of Game Straps that  creates a social game that everyone on the train could play? It might be  fun if such a game was created to connect individuals riding together  rather than isolate them.</p> <p> </p>
