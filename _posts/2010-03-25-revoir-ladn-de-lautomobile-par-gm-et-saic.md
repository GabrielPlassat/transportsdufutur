The motors not only provide power for acceleration, but also bring the vehicle to a stop.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Power for the motors is provided by lithium-ion batteries that produce zero emissions. Recharging can occur from a conventional wall outlet using standard household power, allowing EN-V to travel at least 40 kilometers on a single charge.<span>  </span>EN-V can also improve the efficiency of the public electric infrastructure since the vehicle can communicate with the electric grid to determine the best time to recharge based on overall usage.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By combining the Global Positioning System (GPS) with vehicle-to-vehicle communications and distance-sensing technologies, the EN-V concept can be driven both manually and autonomously. </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Its autonomous operating capability offers the promise of reducing traffic congestion by allowing EN-V to automatically select the fastest route based on real-time traffic information.<span>  </span>The concept also leverages wireless communications to enable a “social network” that can be used by drivers and occupants to communicate with friends or business associates while on the go.<span>  </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><s>This combination of sensing technology, wireless communication and GPS-based navigation establishes a technology foundation, pieces of which could migrate from the EN-V concept and potentially lead the way to future advanced vehicle safety systems.<span>  </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ability to communicate with other vehicles and with the infrastructure could dramatically reduce the number of vehicle accidents.<span>  </span>Using vehicle-based sensor and camera systems, EN-V can “sense” what’s around it, allowing the vehicle to react quickly to obstacles or changes in driving conditions. For example, if a pedestrian steps out in front of the vehicle, EN-V will decelerate to a slower and safer speed and stop sooner than today’s vehicles.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">GM has been a leader in developing autonomous vehicle technology, having worked alongside students and faculty at </span><span lang="EN-US">Carnegie</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US">Mellon</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span lang="EN-US">University</span><span lang="EN-US"> in the </span><span lang="EN-US">U.S.</span><span lang="EN-US"> city of </span><span lang="EN-US">Pittsburgh</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Pennsylvania</span><span lang="EN-US">. This collaboration created “The Boss” Chevrolet Tahoe, which brought autonomous vehicle operation to life in 2007.<span>   </span>EN-V takes the lessons learned in “The Boss” and offers mobility to people who could not otherwise operate a vehicle.<span>    </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“The EN-V concept represents a major breakthrough in the research that GM has been doing to bring vehicle autonomy to life,” said Alan Taub, Global Vice President of GM Research and Development.<span>  </span>“The building blocks that enable the autonomous capabilities found on the EN-V concept such as lane departure warning, blind zone detection and adaptive cruise control are being used in some GM vehicles on the road today.” </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">EN-V has been designed for the speed and range of today’s urban drivers.<span>  </span>It weighs less than 500 kilograms and is about 1.5 meters in length.<span>  </span>By comparison, today’s typical automobile weighs more than 1,500 kilograms and is three times as long.<span>  </span>In addition, today’s automobiles require more than 10 square meters of parking space and are parked more than 90 percent of the time.<span>  </span>EN-V’s smaller size and greater maneuverability mean the same parking lot can accommodate five times as many EN-Vs as typical automobiles.<span>    </span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="text-decoration: none"> </span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-US">Smaller, Smarter Design</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-US"> </span></strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">While EN-V leads the way in terms of efficiency and technology, it also sets a new benchmark for vehicle design.<span>  </span>For its debut, GM had design teams around the world provide their vision of what future mobility will look like.<span>  </span>Xiao (Laugh_x000D_
