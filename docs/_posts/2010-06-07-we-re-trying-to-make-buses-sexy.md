<p style="text-align: justify">The <a href="http://www.mbta.com" target="_blank" title="Link to MBTA"><font color="#2361a1"><strong>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority</strong></font></a> continued its efforts to engage with developer community by releasing <a href="http://www.eot.state.ma.us/developers/realtime/" target="_blank" title="Link to MassDOT"><font color="#2361a1"><strong>real-time data</strong></font></a> - with an interesting MAssDot / Developpers Relationshion principles, see <strong><a href="https://gabrielplassat.github.io/transportsdufutur/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2010/06/RelationshipPrinciples_11-12-2009.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a></strong> - for 12 additional bus routes. This caps what outgoing <a href="http://www.eot.state.ma.us" target="_blank" title="Link to MassDOT"><font color="#2361a1"><strong>MassDOT</strong></font></a> official Chris Dempsey called “an incredibly successful year,” which started when the state released MBTA static route and schedule data last summer. Thanks to a series of <a href="http://www.thetransitwire.com/2010/03/24/massdot-announces-app-winners-more-mbta-data-coming/" target="_blank" title="Link to previous post on The Transit Wire"><font color="#2361a1"><strong>developer challenges</strong></font></a>, and a pilot test of real-time data for five routes, MBTA customers now can choose from about a dozen applications that offer route and schedule information and — in some cases — real-time arrival predictions.</p> <p style="text-align: justify"> </p>  <!--more-->  <p style="text-align: justify">“We’re trying to make buses cool,” said new MBTA general manager Richard Davey. “We’re trying to make buses sexy.” Speaking at a developers conference in Cambridge Thursday night, Davey said that the MBTA used to be reluctant to share real-time information with customers. “We need to be a lot more open and frank,” he told the group. The 17 routes for which real-time info is now available serve about a third of the system’s bus customers. Working in partnership with NextBus, the MBTA will share arrival prediction data for all 185 bus routes by the end of the summer.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Developers were encouraged to create software applications and physical installations using a real-time feed for <a href="http://www.mbta.com" target="_blank" title="Link to MBTA">Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority</a> bus locations and arrival predictions. Currently feeds are available for five routes. Governor Deval Patrick announced the winners via prerecorded video at the March 24 event:</p> <ul> <li> <div style="text-align: justify"><em><a href="http://catchthebusapp.com/" target="_blank" title="Link to Catch the Bus"><font color="#810081">Catch the Bus</font></a></em> provides arrival predictions for iPhones and Android phones </div> <li> <div style="text-align: justify"><em>MBTA Count-down Clock</em>,which can be installed in storefronts and other locations, shows countdown information on a clock face </div></li> </li></ul>  [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-UAujyy45k&hl=fr_FR&fs=1&]
