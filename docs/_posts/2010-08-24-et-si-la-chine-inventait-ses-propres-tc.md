Well, here is an cheaper, greener and fast alternative to lighten their mind up a bit: the <em>straddling</em> bus, first exhibited on the 13th Beijing International High-tech Expo in May this year. In the near future, the model is to be put into pilot use in Beijing’s Mentougou District (<a href="http://epaper.bjnews.com.cn/html/2010-05/28/content_105596.htm?div=-1" target="_blank">bjnews</a>). (The official site of the high-tech expo put it as 3D fast bus, which I think is more confusing, for now I’ll just call it the straddling bus.)</p> <p style="text-align: justify"><img style="border-width: 0px" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2010/08/11.jpg" border="0" alt="子11" width="500" height="198" /></p> <p style="text-align: justify">Proposed by Shenzhen Hashi Future Parking Equipment Co., Ltd, the model looks like a subway or light-rail train bestriding the road. It is 4-4.5 m high with two levels: passengers board on the upper level while other vehicles lower than 2 m can go through under. Powered by electricity and solar energy, the bus can speed up to 60 km/h carrying 1200-1400 passengers at a time without blocking other vehicles’ way. Also it costs about 500 million yuan to build the bus and a 40-km-long path for it, only 10% of building equivalent subway. It is said that the bus can reduce traffic jams by 20-30%.</p>
